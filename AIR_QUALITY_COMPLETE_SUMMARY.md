// Before
<Box sx={{ mt: 3 }}>
  <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
    Air quality visualization coming soon...
  </Typography>
</Box>
```

Created a comprehensive air quality monitoring page with:
- ✅ Real-time data integration from OpenAQ API
- ✅ Custom React hook for data fetching
- ✅ Interactive location selection
- ✅ 6 pollutant measurement cards
- ✅ Overall air quality assessment
- ✅ Health recommendations panel
- ✅ Bar chart for pollutant comparison
